Bingocular
===========================================================================
A quick hack to create an 256x256 overlay tile showing the capture date of a Bing Maps tile as provided in the HTTP metadata.
Sample request:
tiledate.php?z=18&x=134926&y=86121


Installation
===========================================================================

1. Make sure you have a working webserver with PHP5 and GD2
2. Create a ./tiles/ directory, and make sure it's writable by your web server

tile.phps should be a symlink to tile.php
